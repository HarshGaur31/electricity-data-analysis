# Electricity Data Analysis using Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of electricity pricing
and demand data using Python. The goal is to understand price trends, demand
patterns, and basic statistics through data analysis and visualization.

## 📊 Dataset
- Dataset Name: Electricity Dataset
- Format: CSV
- Contains information such as electricity prices, demand, and transfer values.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
- Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas
- Checked data types and basic information
- Calculated average electricity prices
- Analyzed price trends by day
- Visualized results using bar charts

## 📈 Key Insights
- Average electricity price was calculated successfully
- Price variations were observed across different days
- Visualization helped in understanding daily price trends
